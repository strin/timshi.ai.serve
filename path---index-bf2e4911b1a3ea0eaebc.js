The intellectual community inspired me to collect train of thoughts, and transform ideas into words. \n\n*I wrote my first blog post on Wordpress.* The year was 2003, the time when Flash was the dominant media for interactive content, all the hype was around Web 2.0, …\n\nIt has been thrilling to see the web stack evolve over the last 15 years. If you are reading this and want to start a custom blog fast, I recommend Jekyll, for various reasons mentioned in [Karpathy’s blog](http://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/); if you are a risk-taker and would like to join my bold journey of trying something new, \n\n\n> How can we build the blog stack differently in 2018?\n\nIt’s dangerous to pick a solution first, without realizing the problem. What motivates me is the thought that *blog can be not just a list of articles, but a personal network of content delivery*. As a researcher, I would love to have the blog “publish” my papers, rather than just linking to a janky and slow pdf. Or as a photography hobbyist, I’d like to show a responsive gallery of beautiful videos.\n\n![Gatsby.js - A static site generator for progressive web apps.](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_2163C6F6CAF1FD81A4E6DDE8B33FCA22DEC0405AC833670DC493B9C77DDF6F4A_1514357582614_Screen+Shot+2017-12-27+at+2.52.28+PM.png)\n\n\nWith that in mind, I am glad that I come across [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It has the following features:\n\n\n- **Just like Jekyll, a static site generator.** Transforms the site into static files, and can be deployed efficiently through [Content Delivery Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) (CDNs).\n- **Progressive web app.** Gatsby only loads resources on demand, and pre-fetches resources for other pages so the site feels *blazing fast*!\n- **Built on modern web technology.** React, Webpack, and modern CSS.\n\nThe most exciting part is data can be fetched through GraphQL. This means we can use modern Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Contentful.\n\n![Use Contentful as Content Management System](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_2163C6F6CAF1FD81A4E6DDE8B33FCA22DEC0405AC833670DC493B9C77DDF6F4A_1514357836791_Screen+Shot+2017-12-27+at+2.57.01+PM.png)\n\n\n\n\n\n"},published:"2017-12-26T00:00+08:00"}}]}},pathContext:{_PARENT:"SOURCE"}}}});
