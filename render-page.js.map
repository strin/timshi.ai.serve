Or as a photography hobbyist, I’d like to show a responsive gallery of beautiful videos.\\n\\n![Gatsby.js - A static site generator for progressive web apps.](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_2163C6F6CAF1FD81A4E6DDE8B33FCA22DEC0405AC833670DC493B9C77DDF6F4A_1514357582614_Screen+Shot+2017-12-27+at+2.52.28+PM.png)\\n\\n\\nWith that in mind, I am glad that I come across [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). It has the following features:\\n\\n\\n- **Just like Jekyll, a static site generator.** Transforms the site into static files, and can be deployed efficiently through [Content Delivery Networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) (CDNs).\\n- **Progressive web app.** Gatsby only loads resources on demand, and pre-fetches resources for other pages so the site feels *blazing fast*!\\n- **Built on modern web technology.** React, Webpack, and modern CSS.\\n\\nThe most exciting part is data can be fetched through GraphQL. This means we can use modern Content Management Systems (CMS) such as Contentful.\\n\\n![Use Contentful as Content Management System](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_2163C6F6CAF1FD81A4E6DDE8B33FCA22DEC0405AC833670DC493B9C77DDF6F4A_1514357836791_Screen+Shot+2017-12-27+at+2.57.01+PM.png)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"},\"published\":\"2017-12-26T00:00+08:00\"}}]}},\"pathContext\":{\"_PARENT\":\"SOURCE\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/index.json\n// module id = 633\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"pathContext\":{\"_PARENT\":\"SOURCE\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/photos.json\n// module id = 634\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"pathContext\":{\"_PARENT\":\"SOURCE\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/project.json\n// module id = 635\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = {\"pathContext\":{\"_PARENT\":\"SOURCE\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./.cache/json/404-html.json\n// module id = 636\n// module chunks = 0","\n  import React from \"react\"\n  import Component from \"/Users/tims/timshi.ai/home/src/layouts/index.js\"\n  import data from \"/Users/tims/timshi.ai/home/.cache/json/layout-index.json\"\n\n  export default (props) => <Component {...props} {...data} />\n  \n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./.cache/layouts/index.js","import React from 'react'\n\nimport '../styles/index.scss'\nimport Header from '../components/Header'\nimport Footer from '../components/Footer'\n\nconst Layout = ({ children }) => (\n  <div className='flex flex-column flex-auto min-vh-100 sans-serif'>\n    <Header />\n    <main className='flex-auto'>\n      { children() }\n    </main>\n    <Footer />\n  </div>\n)\n\nexport default Layout\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/layouts/index.js","// empty (null-loader)\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/styles/index.scss\n// module id = 639\n// module chunks = 0","import Header from './Header'\n\nexport default Header\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Header/index.js","import React, { Component } from 'react'\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link'\n\nimport Nav from './Nav'\nimport MobileNav from './MobileNav'\nimport Hamburger from './Hamburger'\nimport Container from '../Container'\nimport ZapSVG from '../../content/images/zap-v2.svg'\n\nclass Header extends Component {\n  state = { open: false }\n\n  closeNav = () => {\n    this.setState({ open: false })\n  }\n\n  toggleNav = e => {\n    e.preventDefault()\n    this.setState({ open: !this.state.open })\n  }\n\n  render () {\n    const { open } = this.state\n\n    return (\n      <header className='flex-column w-100 overflow-y-hidden'>\n        <Container className='flex flex-row wrap justify-start items-center pv3 bg-inherit relative z-2'>\n          <div className='flex-auto w-third dn-ns' />\n          <div className='flex-auto w-third tc tl-ns'>\n          </div>\n          <div className='flex-auto w-third dn-ns relative tr pr3'>\n            <Hamburger open={open} onClick={this.toggleNav} />\n          </div>\n          <Nav className='dn flex-ns flex-row' />\n        </Container>\n        { open &&\n          <div\n            onClick={this.closeNav}\n            className='db w-100 h-100 top-0 left-0 absolute'\n          />\n        }\n        <MobileNav open={open} onNavigate={this.closeNav} />\n      </header>\n    )\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Header\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Header/Header.js","import React from 'react'\nimport Link from 'gatsby-link'\nimport styles from './Nav.css'\n\n\nconst NavLink = ({\n  className,\n  ...props\n}) => (\n  <h3>\n    <Link\n      {...props}\n      className={styles.nav}\n    >\n        {props.children}\n    </Link>\n  </h3>\n)\n\nconst Nav = ({\n  onNavigate,\n  ...props\n}) => (\n  <nav {...props}>\n      <NavLink activeStyle={{}}\n        key='index'\n        to={`/`}\n        exact\n        onClick={onNavigate}>Recents</NavLink>\n      <NavLink activeStyle={{}}\n        key='project'\n        to={`/project`}\n        onClick={onNavigate}>Projects</NavLink>\n      <NavLink activeStyle={{}}\n        key='photos'\n        to={`/photos`}\n        onClick={onNavigate}>Photos</NavLink>\n      <NavLink activeStyle={{}}\n        key='about'\n        to={`/about`}\n        onClick={onNavigate}>About</NavLink>\n  </nav>\n)\n\nexport default Nav\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/components/Header/Nav.js","// empty (null-loader)\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/components/Header/Nav.css\n// module id = 643\n// module chunks = 0","import React from 'react'\nimport { Motion, spring } from 'react-motion'\n\nimport Nav from './Nav'\n\nconst MobileNav = ({ open, ...props }) => (\n  <Motion\n    style={{ offsetY: spring(open ?
